          I was born in France, and currently live in Montreal, QC Canada.
          I have an Associate's degree in Computer Science from France,
          and worked in Web development for more than 10 years.
          I presently work as Senior Council for CGI Canada on an important project for the city hall of Montreal.
          During my free time, I like to freelance as this is where my passion lies and learn new technology and tools.
          I think itâ€™s important to love doing what you do, so the passion will continue to motivate and improve yourself.
